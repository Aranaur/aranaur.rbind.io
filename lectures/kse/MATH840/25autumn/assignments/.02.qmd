## 🎯 Goals

The goal of this assignment is to dive deep into the datasets you collected in the first assignment using visual analysis techniques. You will learn to create and interpret key time series plots to identify their main characteristics, such as trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation. This stage is critically important in preparing for modeling and forecasting.

## 📚 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed **Assignment 01**. For this assignment, you will be using the same 3-5 datasets that you collected and validated. All your data should be loaded into a `pandas` DataFrame with the time/date columns correctly formatted.

## 📝 Instructions

For **each** of your chosen datasets, perform the steps below. Your goal is not just to generate plots, but also to provide detailed descriptions of what you observe in them.

### Part 1: Basic Time Series Analysis

1.  **Time Plot:**
    *   Construct a basic time plot, where the X-axis represents time and the Y-axis represents the series' values.
    *   **Interpretation:** Describe what you see. Is there a clear **trend** (upward or downward)? Are **seasonal** fluctuations visible? Are there any unusual observations or outliers?

### Part 2: In-Depth Seasonality Analysis

1.  **Seasonal Plot:**
    *   Create a seasonal plot by overlaying corresponding periods on top of each other (e.g., year over year for monthly data, or day over day for hourly data).
    *   **Interpretation:** Does this plot confirm the presence of seasonality? Are there certain years or periods that stand out from the others? How stable is the seasonal pattern over time?

2.  **Seasonal Subseries Plot:**
    *   Generate a subseries plot, where the data for each season (e.g., for each month) is displayed as a separate mini-plot.
    *   **Interpretation:** How does the series' value change within each season across the years? Is there growth or decline in specific months/quarters? This plot helps to see how the seasonality itself is changing.

### Part 3: Autocorrelation Analysis

1.  **Lag Plot:**
    *   Create several lag plots for different lag values (e.g., for lags 1 through 4).
    *   **Interpretation:** Is there a linear relationship visible in these plots? How does the structure of the relationship change as the lag increases?

2.  **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) Plot:**
    *   Plot the ACF for your time series. Choose a sufficient number of lags to see potential seasonal patterns (e.g., 24 for monthly data with yearly seasonality, 52 for weekly data).
    *   **Interpretation:** Describe the behavior of the ACF.
        *   Do the coefficients decay slowly? (This is a sign of a trend).
        *   Are there significant coefficients at seasonal lags (e.g., at lags 12, 24 for monthly data)? (This is a sign of seasonality).

### Part 4: Relationships Between Variables (Optional)

*   If your dataset contains multiple time series (e.g., electricity demand and temperature), investigate the relationship between them.
    1.  **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot between two variables.
    2.  **Scatterplot Matrix:** If you have more than two variables, build a matrix to visualize pairwise correlations.
    3.  **Interpretation:** Is there a visible relationship between the variables? Is it positive or negative? How strong is it?

### Part 5: Synthesis of Results

*   For each dataset, write a brief summary (2-3 paragraphs). Synthesize the key characteristics of the time series that you identified through your visualizations. Describe which patterns (trend, seasonality, cycles) are most prominent.

## 📤 Submission Requirements

Submit a Quarto document (`.qmd`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), along with the rendered HTML file, containing:

*   The code used to create all the plots for each of your datasets.
*   The plots themselves, as generated by your code.
*   Markdown cells with your detailed interpretations and conclusions for each step.
*   A final synthesis of your findings for each dataset.

::: {.callout-tip}
Structure your report clearly, using headings for each dataset and for each part of the analysis. This will make it easier to review and will demonstrate the logic of your investigation.
