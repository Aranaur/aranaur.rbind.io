### 🎯 **Goals**

The goal of this assignment is to compare two fundamental strategies for time series forecasting. You will learn to apply simple forecasting methods directly to the data and, alternatively, to use them to forecast the components of a series after decomposition. This will allow you to determine whether decomposing a series into its trend, seasonal, and remainder components improves the accuracy of the final forecasts.

### 📚 **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have completed **Assignments 01, 02, and 03**. You will use the same 3-5 datasets, which should be cleaned and prepared for analysis.

### 📝 **Instructions**

For **each** of your chosen time series datasets, perform the steps below. Your analysis must be supported by both generated plots and detailed interpretations of your findings.

---

#### **Part 1: Create Training and Test Sets**

The first step in any forecasting task is to split your data to avoid overfitting and to objectively evaluate model performance.

1.  **Split the Data:**
    *   Divide each of your time series into a **training set** and a **test set**. The test set should consist of the most recent observations (e.g., the last 20% of the data). Ensure the test set is long enough for a robust evaluation (for seasonal data, this should be at least one full seasonal cycle).
    *   **Action:** Clearly state the time range for the training and test sets for each of your series.

---

#### **Part 2: Choose and Implement a Forecasting Strategy**

You now have the option to choose one of the two following forecasting approaches (or implement both to compare them).

**Strategy A: Direct Forecasting (Using Simple Models)**

This approach involves applying benchmark models directly to the training data.

1.  **Generate Forecasts:**
    *   Fit the following models to the **training data**:
        *   Mean Method
        *   Naïve Method
        *   Seasonal Naïve Method (*only if the series is seasonal*)
        *   Drift Method
    *   Generate forecasts from each model for a forecast horizon equal to the length of your **test set**.

**Strategy B: Decomposition-Based Forecasting**

This approach involves decomposing the series, forecasting the components separately, and then recombining them.

1.  **Decompose the Series:**
    *   Perform an **STL decomposition** on the **training set**. This will separate your data into a `seasonal` component and a `seasonally adjusted` component (trend + remainder).

2.  **Forecast Each Component:**
    *   **Seasonal Component:** Forecast this using the **Seasonal Naïve method**.
    *   **Seasonally Adjusted Component:** Forecast this using either the **Naïve method** or the **Drift method**. Justify which method is more appropriate for the trend in your data.

3.  **Combine the Forecasts:**
    *   Add the forecasts of the seasonal and seasonally adjusted components together to get the final forecast.

#### **Part 3: Evaluate Accuracy and Compare Strategies**

Regardless of the strategy chosen, you must evaluate its accuracy.

1.  **Visualize the Results:**
    *   Create a plot for each time series that shows:
        *   The training data.
        *   The test data (the actual values).
        *   The forecasts generated by your chosen strategy (or both strategies, if you are comparing).

2.  **Calculate Accuracy Metrics:**
    *   For each model/strategy, calculate the forecast errors (the difference between the forecasted values and the actual values in the **test set**).
    *   Compute the following metrics: **RMSE**, **MAE**, **MAPE**, and **MASE**.
    *   Organize the results into a table for easy comparison.

3.  **Draw Conclusions:**
    *   **Interpretation:** Which method or strategy was the most accurate for each time series? Justify why the winning approach was most effective (e.g., "The decomposition-based strategy performed better because it allowed for the complex trend to be modeled separately from the seasonality...").

#### **Part 4: Residual Diagnostics for the Best Model**

For the best-performing model/strategy identified in the previous part, conduct a residual analysis.

1.  **Analyze the Residuals:**
    *   Obtain the **residuals** by applying your best model to the **training data**.
    *   Perform the following residual diagnostics:
        1.  Plot the residuals over time.
        2.  Plot the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of the residuals.
        3.  Plot a histogram of the residuals to check their distribution.
        4.  Perform a **Ljung-Box test** to formally check for autocorrelation.

2.  **Interpret the Diagnostics:**
    *   **Interpretation:** Do the residuals resemble **white noise**? Is their mean close to zero, and is there no significant autocorrelation? Conclude whether your best model is adequate for the series or if there is information left in the residuals that a more sophisticated model might capture.

### 📤 **Submission Requirements**

Submit a Quarto document (`.qmd`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), along with the rendered HTML file, containing:

*   The code for all steps of the analysis.
*   All generated plots and tables.
*   Detailed interpretations and conclusions for each step.
