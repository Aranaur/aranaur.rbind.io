The data in this problem set come from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS), which I downloaded from [IPUMS](https://ipums.org/).

The dataset contains the following variables:

```{r, background variables, echo = F}
# Load requisite packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, kableExtra, here)
# Load data
acs_sub = here("001-data.rds") %>% read_rds()
# Create table of variable descriptions
var_tbl = data.frame(
  Variable = names(acs_sub) %>% paste0(".mono-small[", ., "]"),
  Description = c(
    "State abbreviation",
    "Binary indicator for whether home county is 'urban'",
    "The individual's age (in years)",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as Asian",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as Black",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as Hispanic",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified with a group indigenous to North Am.",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as White",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as Female",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual identified as Male",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual graduated college (estimated)",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual was married at the time of the sample",
    "Total (annual) personal income (tens of thousands of dollars)",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual uses 'foodstamps' (SNAP)",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual has health insurance",
    "Binary indicator for whether the individual has access to the internet",
    "The time that the individual typically leaves for work (in minutes since midnight)",
    "The time that the individual typically arrives at work (in minutes since midnight)",
    "The length of time that the individual typically travels to work (in minutes)"
  )
)
kable(var_tbl) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
