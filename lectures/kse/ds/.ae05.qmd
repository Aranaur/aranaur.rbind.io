# Goals

- Conduct a hypothesis test for a proportion.

# Packages

We’ll use the `tidyverse`.

# Case study 1: Donors

The first dataset we’ll use is [`organ_donor`](https://aranaur.rbind.io/datasets/organ-donor/).

According to the results of the study, the number of complications during organ transplantation does not exceed 10%. We want to test this hypothesis.

## Exercise 1

Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.

## Exercise 2

Calculate the $p$-value for the test.

## Exercise 3

Conduct the test at the 5% significance level.

## Exercise 4

Interpret the results of the test.
