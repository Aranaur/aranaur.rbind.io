## Logic

```{r}
#| label: logical-operations

1 > 2 & 1 > 0.5 ## The "&" stands for "and"

isTRUE (1 < 2)
```

You can read more about logical operators and types [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Logic.html) and [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/logical.html).

## Logic (cont.) {.smaller}

#### Order of precedence

Much like standard arithmetic, logic statements follow a strict order of precedence. Logical operators (`>`, `==`, etc) are evaluated before Boolean operators (`&` and `|`). Failure to recognise this can lead to unexpected behaviour...

```{r}
1 > 0.5 & 2
```

What's happening here is that R is evaluating two separate "logical" statements:

- `1 > 0.5`, which is is obviously TRUE.
- `2`, which is TRUE(!) because R is "helpfully" converting it to `as.logical(2)`.

**Solution:** Be explicit about each component of your logic statement(s).

```{r}
1 > 0.5 & 1 > 2
```

## Logic (cont.)

#### Negation: `!`

We use `!` as a short hand for negation. This will come in very handy when we start filtering data objects based on non-missing (i.e. non-NA) observations.

```{r}
is.na(1:10)
!is.na(1:10)
# Negate(is.na)(1:10) ## This also works. Try it yourself.
```

## Logic (cont.) {.smaller}

**Value matching:** `%in%`

To see whether an object is contained within (i.e. matches one of) a list of items, use `%in%`.

```{r}
4 %in% 1:10
4 %in% 5:10
```

. . .

There's no equivalent "not in" command, but how might we go about creating one?

- Hint: Think about negation...

. . .

```{r}
`%ni%`  <- Negate(`%in%`) ## The backticks (`) help to specify functions.
4 %ni% 5:10
```

## Logic (cont.)

**Evaluation**

We'll get to assignment shortly. However, to preempt it somewhat, we always use two equal signs for logical evaluation.

```{r, error=T}
#| label: logical-evaluation
#| error: true

1 = 1 ## This doesn't work
1 == 1 ## This does.
1 != 2 ## Note the single equal sign when combined with a negation.
```

## Logic (cont.) {.smaller}

**Evaluation caveat:** Floating-point numbers

What do you think will happen if we evaluate `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3`?

. . .

```{r floating1}
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
```
Uh-oh! (Or, maybe you're thinking: Huh??)

. . .

**Problem:** Computers represent numbers as binary (i.e. base 2) floating-points. More [here](https://floating-point-gui.de/basic/).

- Fast and memory efficient, but can lead to unexpected behaviour. 
- Similar to the way that standard decimal (i.e. base 10) representation can't precisely capture certain fractions (e.g. $\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333...$). 

. . .

**Solution:** Use `all.equal()` for evaluating floats (i.e  fractions).

```{r floating2}
all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
```

## Assignment {.smaller}

In R, we can use either `<-` or `=` to handle assignment.

. . .

Assignment with `<-`:

`<-` is normally read aloud as "gets". You can think of it as a (left-facing) arrow saying *assign in this direction*.

```{r}
a <- 10 + 5
a
```

. . .

Of course, an arrow can point in the other direction too (i.e. `->`). So, the following code chunk is equivalent to the previous one, although used much less frequently.

```{r}
10 + 5 -> a
```

## Assignment (cont.)

**Assignment with `=`**

You can also use `=` for assignment.

```{r}
b = 10 + 10 ## Note that the assigned object *must* be on the left with "=".
b
```

. . .

**Which assignment operator to use?**

Most R users seem to prefer `<-` for assignment, since `=` also has specific role for evaluation *within* functions.

**Bottom line:** Use whichever you prefer. Just be consistent.

## Help {.tiny}

For more information on a (named) function or object in R, consult the "help" documentation. For example:

```R
help(plot)
```

Or, more simply, just use `?`:
  
```R
# This is what most people use.
?plot 
```

Or, just use `F1`.

. . .

</br>

**Aside 1:** Comments in R are demarcated by `#`.

- Hit `Ctrl+Shift+c` in RStudio to (un)comment whole sections of highlighted code.

. . .

**Aside 2:** See the *Examples* section at the bottom of the help file?

- You can run them with the `example()` function. Try it: `example(plot)`.

## Help (cont.) {.smaller}

**Vignettes**

For many packages, you can also try the `vignette()` function, which will provide an introduction to a package and it's purpose through a series of helpful examples.

- Try running `vignette("dplyr")` in your console now.

. . .

I highly encourage reading package vignettes if they are available. 

- They are often the best way to learn how to use a package.

. . .

One complication is that you need to know the exact name of the package vignette(s).

- E.g. The `dplyr` package actually has several vignettes associated with it: "dplyr", "window-functions", "programming", etc.
- You can run `vignette()` (i.e. without any arguments) to list the available vignettes of every *installed* package installed on your system. 
- Or, run `vignette(all = FALSE)` if you only want to see the vignettes of any *loaded* packages.

## Help (cont.)

Similar to vignettes, many packages come with built-in, interactive demos.

To list all available demos on your system:

```r
demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
```

. . .

To run a specific demo, just tell R which one and the name of the parent package. For example:

```r
demo("graphics", package = "graphics")
```

## Reserved words {.smaller}

We've seen that we can assign objects to different names. However, there are a number of special words that are "reserved" in R.

- These are are fundamental commands, operators and relations in base R that you cannot (re)assign, even if you wanted to.
- We already encountered examples with the logical operators.

See [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a full list, including (but not limited to):

```R
if 
else 
while 
function 
for
TRUE 
FALSE 
NULL 
Inf 
NaN 
NA
```

## Semi-reserved words {.tiny}

In addition to the list of strictly reserved words, there is a class of words and strings that I am going to call "semi-reserved".

- These are named functions or constants (e.g. `pi`) that you can re-assign if you really wanted to... but already come with important meanings from base R.

Arguably the most important semi-reserved character is `c()`, which we use for concatenation; i.e. creating vectors and binding different objects together.

```{r}
my_vector = c(1, 2, 5)
my_vector
```

. . .

What happens if you type the following? (Try it in your console.)

```R
c = 4
c(1, 2 ,5)
```

. . .

Vectors are very important in R, because the language has been optimised for them. Don't worry about this now; later you'll learn what I mean by "vectorising" a function.

## Semi-reserved words (cont.) {.smaller}

*(Continued from previous slide.)*

In this case, thankfully nothing. R is "smart" enough to distinguish between the variable `c = 4` that we created and the built-in function `c()` that calls for concatenation.

. . .

However, this is still *extremely* sloppy coding. R won't always be able to distinguish between conflicting definitions. And neither will you. For example:
```{r}
pi
pi = 2
pi
```

. . .

**Bottom line:** Don't use (semi-)reserved characters!

## Namespace conflicts

A similar issue crops up when we load two packages, which have functions that share the same name. E.g. Look what happens we load the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

. . .

The messages that you see about some object being *masked from 'package:X'* are warning you about a namespace conflict.

- E.g. Both `dplyr` and the `stats` package (which gets loaded automatically when you start R) have functions named "filter" and "lag".

## Namespace conflicts (cont.) {.smaller}

The potential for namespace conflicts is a result of the OOP approach[^oop].

- Also reflects the fundamental open-source nature of R and the use of external packages. People are free to call their functions whatever they want, so some overlap is only to be expected.

[^oop]: Similar problems arise in virtually every other programming language (Python, C, etc.)

. . .

Whenever a namespace conflict arises, the most recently loaded package will gain preference. So the `filter()` function now refers specifically to the `dplyr` variant.

But what if we want the `stats` variant? Well, we have two options:

1. Temporarily use `stats::filter()`
2. Permanently assign `filter = stats::filter`

## Solving namespace conflicts {.smaller}

1. Use `package::function()`

We can explicitly call a conflicted function from a particular package using the `package::function()` syntax. For example:
```{r}
stats::filter(1:10, rep(1, 2))
```

. . .

We can also use `::` for more than just conflicted cases. 

- E.g. Being explicit about where a function (or dataset) comes from can help add clarity to our code. Try these lines of code in your R console.

```r
dplyr::starwars ## Print the starwars data frame from the dplyr package
scales::comma(c(1000, 1000000)) ## Use the comma function, which comes from the scales package
```

The `::` syntax also means that we can call functions without loading package first. E.g. As long as `dplyr` is installed on our system, then `dplyr::filter(iris, Species=="virginica")` will work.

## Solving namespace conflicts (cont.)

2. Assign `function  <- package::function`
  
A more permanent solution is to assign a conflicted function name to a particular package. This will hold for the remainder of your current R session, or until you change it back. E.g.

```{r, eval=F}
filter  <- stats::filter ## Note the lack of parentheses.
filter  <- dplyr::filter ## Change it back again.
```

## Solving namespace conflicts (cont.)

3. Use `conflict_prefer()`

```{r}
#| label: conflict-prefer
#| eval: false

#> ✖️ dplyr::filter()  masks stats::filter()

library(conflicted)
conflict_prefer("filter", winner = "dplyr")
```

## User-side namespace conflicts

A final thing to say about namespace conflicts is that they don't only arise from loading packages. They can arise when users create their own functions with a conflicting name.

<br>

In a similar vein, one of the most common and confusing errors that even experienced R programmers run into is related to the habit of calling objects ["df"]{.hi} or ["data"]{.hi}... both of which are functions in base R!

<br>

See for yourself by typing `?df` or `?data`.
