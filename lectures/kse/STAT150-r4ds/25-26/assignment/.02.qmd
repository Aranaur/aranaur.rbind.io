## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Import and explore real-world datasets from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.
- Use `dplyr` functions to filter, arrange, and select subsets of data.
- Create new variables with `mutate()`.
- Summarize grouped data with `group_by()` + `summarise()`.
- Reshape messy datasets using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.
- Apply piping (`|>`) for readable workflows.

## 📂 Dataset

For this assignment, each student should choose *any dataset* from the [TidyTuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).


::: {.callout-tip}
## 👉 Recommendations

- Pick a dataset that **interests you** (e.g., food, sports, education, social trends, space, animals).
- **Avoid** datasets that are **too small** (less than 100 rows) or **too complicated** (multiple nested tables).
- **Read the description** and **context** of the dataset on the TidyTuesday page to understand its variables and structure.
- From my experience, I know it is very tempting to find “the one” dataset. **Do not spend too much time searching**. Just pick one and start working with it.
:::

Load the dataset directly from GitHub using `readr::read_csv()` or read the instructions on the TidyTuesday page for that week. For example, you can use the following code to load the dataset for the week of October 22, 2024:

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-10-22')
tuesdata$cia_factbook
```

## 📝 Tasks

::: {.callout-important}
Below is only a *basic* scenario. Please take the initiative of a researcher --- ask questions about the data and find answers to them. This is much more interesting than simply "memorizing" the language's syntax.
:::

1. **Import and Explore the Data**:
   - Load the dataset into R.
   - Use functions like `head()`, `glimpse()`, and `summary()` to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Filtering & Selecting**:
   - Apply at least two filtering conditions (e.g., values above a threshold, excluding missing data).
   - Select 3–5 relevant variables. Show the first 10 rows.
   - Find the top 5 records according to some numeric variable of your choice.
3. **Mutating Variables**:
   - Create a new column that is a ratio, difference, or transformation of existing variables.
   - Identify the record with the maximum value of this new variable.
4. **Grouping & Summarizing**:
    - Group the data by a categorical variable and calculate summary statistics (mean, median, count) for a numeric variable.
    - Present the results in a clear table.
    - **Interpret the findings.**

::: {.callout-note}
For some datasets, you may need to join multiple tables or tidy the data first using `pivot_longer()` or `pivot_wider()`. Feel free to do so if necessary.
