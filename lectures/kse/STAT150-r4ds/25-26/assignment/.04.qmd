## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will learn to:

- Craft a data-driven narrative using `ggplot2`.
- Create sophisticated multi-layered plots (e.g., combining `geom_point`, `geom_smooth`, `geom_text` etc.).
- Master advanced aesthetic mappings to convey complex relationships.
- Design custom themes and annotations to create publication-ready visualizations.
- Explore extensions to `ggplot2` to create dynamic or composite plots.
- Think critically about visualization choices and justify them in a clear, concise manner.

## 📂 Dataset

Reuse the dataset from Assignment 02 (the one you tidied and wrangled). You already prepared it — now it’s time to visualize! Or choose a new dataset from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Especially if it's a Netflix dataset 🙃

## 📝 The Challenge

Imagine you are a data journalist. Your task is to create a visual story using your dataset.

Your audience: *curious readers who don’t know R, statistics, or data science*.

Your mission: *make the data speak clearly, visually, and persuasively*.

### Instructions

1. Choose a dataset (your tidied dataset from Assignment 02 or a new one from TidyTuesday).
2. Identify a compelling story or insight within the data that you want to communicate.
3. Create a series of visualizations using `ggplot2` (and its extensions if desired) to illustrate your story. Aim for at least 3-5 different plots.
4. Write a narrative that ties the visualizations together, explaining the insights and significance of each plot.
5. Use Quarto to compile your visualizations and narrative into a cohesive document.
