::: {.callout-note}
This is just one possible scenario. You can design your own hypothesis and compare other groups or distributions.

## 🎯 Context

You are a data analyst working for an EdTech company that helps users learn foreign languages through online practice. The team wants to better understand how different types of users engage with the product.

One of the open questions is whether users from different segments (by region, motivation, or subscription type) behave similarly in terms of how long they spend per session — or whether their engagement patterns differ significantly.

Your task is to apply the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test[^other-test] to explore this.

[^other-test]: You can also compere the results with an alternative tests.

## 📋 Problem description

You are given a [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/102PFY_435D5zVAm-JTOd4JbXo9kRn-gm/view?usp=sharing) with anonymized user behavior:

| `motivation`             | String, answer to the question during registration: *What is the main reason you want to learn a new language?*                                     |
| `subscription_type`      | String, type of the user’s subscription:<br>• **Core** – Standard access to all experiences except Live<br>• **Live** – Access to all experiences + Live |

| `learning_activity`      | String, learning activity used in the session                                                                                                       |
| `learning_os`            | String, operating system of the user’s device                                                                                                       |

| `session_ended_as`       | String, state in which the session ended: *completed*, *aborted*, or *missing*                                                                     |
| `session_started_at`     | Timestamp of learning session start (in UTC)                                                                                                        |
| `session_local_started_at`| Timestamp of learning session start in the user’s local timezone                                                                                   |

You will:

- Explore the distribution of session duration (`time_spent`) for different groups of users
- Compare two user groups and test whether they follow the same distribution
- Visualize the empirical distribution and draw conclusions

## 🔧 Steps to follow

1. 📥 Filter and analyze the data
2. 🧪 Compare two groups (2-sample K–S test)
    + Choose two groups of users to compare.
    + Formulate the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
3. 📈 Visualize the distributions
4. ✍️ Conclusions
    + Report the statistic and p-values for each test
    + Interpret the results
