## 🎯 Context

You are an analyst in a team that studies human behavior in online experiments. You have been asked to assess how “randomly” people can generate numbers when asked to do so.

## 📋 Problem description

You have two sets of data:

1. “Human Random Numbers” --- a list of numbers that students entered on their own when asked to generate a random sample from the interval [0-100].
2. “Real random numbers” --- numbers generated.

Your task:

- Test the hypothesis that the data generated by humans comes from a uniform distribution.
- Conduct the Kolmogorov test to test the hypothesis.
- Visualize the distributions, empirical and theoretical CDF.
- Write a brief conclusion.

## 🔧 Steps to follow

1. 📥 Use the [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hG_25DCI2fMz210fCt84q-sVth3CNRBAT1OlT7zvKBk/edit?gid=1798635135#gid=1798635135)[^reddit].
2. 📊 Draw a histogram and empirical distribution function for each data set.
3. 📈 Run the Kolmogorov test:
    + $H_0$: The data come from a uniform distribution on [0, 100].
    + $H_1$: The distribution is not uniform.
4. 🧪 For the control group (uniform_generated), also check the KS-test (does the test work when the hypothesis is true?).
5. ✍️ Write a brief conclusion:
    + Can the “human” data be considered truly random?
    + Were there any systematic deviations (e.g. avoidance of extreme values)?
