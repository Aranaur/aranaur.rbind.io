## 🎯 Context

As a Data Scientist at a leading online travel agency, you’ve been tasked with evaluating the impact of a new search ranking algorithm designed to improve conversion rates. The Product team is considering a full rollout, but only if the experiment shows a clear positive effect on the conversion rate and does not lead to a longer time to book.

They have shared A/B test datasets with session-level booking data ([`"sessions_data.csv"`](data/sessions_data.csv)) and user-level control/variant split ([`"users_data.csv"`](data/users_data.csv)). Your job is to analyze and interpret the results to determine whether the new ranking system delivers a statistically significant improvement and provide a clear, data-driven recommendation.

## 🗂️ Datasets structure

- `sessions_data.csv` 

| column | data type | description | 
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `session_id` | `string` / `str` | Unique session identifier (unique for each row) |
| `user_id` | `string` / `str` | Unique user identifier (non logged-in users have missing user_id values; each user can have multiple sessions) |
| `session_start_timestamp` | `string` / `str` | When a session started |
| `booking_timestamp` | `string` / `str` | When a booking was made (missing if no booking was made during a session) |
| `time_to_booking` | `float` / `double` | time from start of the session to booking, in minutes (missing if no booking was made during a session) |
| `conversion` | `integer` | _New column to create:_ did session end up with a booking (0 if booking_timestamp or time_to_booking is Null, otherwise 1) |

<br>

- `users_data.csv`

| column | data type | description | 
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `user_id` | `string` / `str` | Unique user identifier (only logged-in users in this table) |
| `experiment_group` | `string` / `str` | control / variant split for the experiment (expected to be equal 50/50) |

## 🧪 Task

The full on criteria are the following:

- Primary metric (`conversion`) effect must be statistically significant and show positive effect (increase).
- Guardrail (`time_to_booking`) effect must either be statistically insignificant or show positive effect (decrease)

### 🔧 Steps to follow

1. 📥 **Data Preparation**: Load the datasets, merge them on `user_id`, and create the `conversion` column in `sessions_data.csv`.
2. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualize the distribution of `conversion` and `time_to_booking` for both control and variant groups.
   - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for both metrics in each group.
3. 🧪 **Statistical Testing**:
    - Formulate hypotheses for both metrics.
    - Perform statistical tests to compare the control and variant groups. Try to use different tests for each metric.
4. ✍🏻 **Interpretation**:
    - Analyze the results of the statistical tests.
    - Write a short interpretation of the findings, including whether the new ranking system is effective and if it meets the guardrail criteria.
4. 📝 **Reporting**:
    - Compile your findings into a laboratory report in PDF/HTML format.
    - Include code, graphs, hypotheses, decisions, and a short written interpretation.
5. 📤 **Submission**: Submit your report as a PDF or HTML file.

## 📝 Result
Laboratory report in PDF/HTML[^html] format with:

- Code
- Graphs
- Hypotheses and decisions
- Short written interpretation
