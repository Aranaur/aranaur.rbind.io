# Input

We decided to analyze the yields of two cryptocurrencies. But before investing in one or the other currency, it is necessary to study the distributions of these yields.

# Task

::: {.callout-important}
**We expect all the results to be interpreted in the task context.**

## Data

Gather data on two cryptocurrencies at the **close** of the stock exchange for the last few days. For each cryptocurrency, determine its yield per day.

Formula for calculating the yield:

$$
\text{Yield} = \frac{P_{t} - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \times 100\% = \log\left(\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\right) \times 100\%
$$

where $P_{t}$ is the price of the cryptocurrency at time $t$.

The [`cryptoQuotes`](https://serkor1.github.io/cryptoQuotes/) package for R can be used as a data source. For example, the following code can be used to collect data on the bitcoin rate:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

library(tidyverse)
library(cryptoQuotes)

BTC <- cryptoQuotes::get_quote(
  ticker   = 'BTCUSDT', # <1>
  source   = 'binance', # <2>
  futures  = TRUE,     # <3>
  interval = '1d',    # <4>
  from     = Sys.Date() - 199 # <5>
) %>% 
  as_tibble() # <6>
```

1. 'ticker' - a cryptocurrency ticker.
2. `source` - the exchange from which we receive data.
3. Futures - futures.
4. `interval` - data interval.
5. `from` - the date of the start of data collection (the `Sys.Date()` function returns the current date).
6. `as_tibble()` - converting data to the `tibble` format.


```{r}
#| eval: true
head(BTC) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Tips for using the `cryptoQuotes` package
- `available_tickers()` - available tickers.
- `available_exchanges()` - available exchanges.
- `available_intervals()` - available intervals.

## How to analyze the yield

1. Collect data on the yield of two cryptocurrencies.
2. Use statistical methods to analyze the yield distributions.
3. Use visualizations to compare the yield distributions of the two cryptocurrencies.
4. Check the normality of the yield distribution for each cryptocurrency[^norm].
5. Write conclusions based on the analysis of the yield distributions.

::: {.callout-note}
You can further compare the average returns using appropriate hypotheses and tests.

[^norm]: We expect you to use all the methods we learned in class to test the normality of a distribution.
