# Input

The World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.

Link to the dataset: [World Happiness 2015](https://aranaur.rbind.io/datasets/happiness/)

# Task

## Mann-Whitney U test

::: {.callout-note}
Also you can use your own logic to solve the task and compare the results.
:::

1. Load the dataset and familiarize yourself with it.
2. Check the distribution of the `Happiness Score` variable.
3. Divide the dataset into two groups based on the `Region` variable.
4. Check the distribution of the `Happiness Score` variable in each group.
5. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, check if there is a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the `Happiness Score` variable between the two groups.

::: {.callout-tip}
Can we use other statistical tests to compare the distribution of the `Happiness Score` variable between the two groups?
