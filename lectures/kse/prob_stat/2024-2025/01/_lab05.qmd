# Input

Your company has a smartphone app that allows users to make purchases. To conduct A/B testing, you use your platform that can divide users into groups and collect data about their behavior using a split system. To verify that the split system is working correctly, you conduct A/A testing: divide users into two groups, but do not change anything about their experience with the application.

::: {.callout-tip}
## What is A/A testing?

A/A testing is an experiment in which two groups of users get the same experience of interacting with a product. This allows you to check the split system's correctness and ensure that it divides users into groups correctly. **That is, it is expected that there will be no differences between the groups**.

# Task

::: {.callout-important}
**We expect all the results to be interpreted in the task context.**
:::

It is necessary to calculate the results of the A/A test, checking the FPR quality metric (we will check for **conversion to purchase**):

$$
\text{Conversion rate} = \frac{\text{Number of purchases}}{\text{Number of users}}
$$

It is known that the split system is broken.

You need to check the claim of a breakdown and find its causes if the split system is really broken.

## Data

Data set you can find here: [link](https://aranaur.rbind.io/datasets/aa_test/)

Variables in the dataset:

- `uid`: user identifier
- `experimentVariant`: experiment variant
- `version`: version of the application
- `purchase`: the fact of purchase

## How to check the breakdown

1. Run the A/A test.
2. Calculate the FPR at $\alpha$ = 0.05 (set up subsamples with no return volume of 1000). You will see that FPR > $\alpha$! We need the opposite --- to be less.
3. Find the reasons for the split system failure based on the experiment's results (hint: find the anomaly in the application version).
4. Write conclusions that can be drawn based on the analysis of the A/A test results.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
- Calculate the conversion rate (purchase rate), grouping by the variant and version of the application. It may already become clear where precisely the causes of the breakdown are.
- Calculate the $p$-value for each version of the application.
- Find versions where $p$-value < 0.05.
- Exclude the version with $p$-value < 0.05 from the main data table
- Rerun the FPR calculation through A/A. Now, FPR should be less than $\alpha$.
- You find the cause of the breakdown.
