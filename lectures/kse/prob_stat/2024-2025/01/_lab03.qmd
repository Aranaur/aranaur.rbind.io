# Input

The Internet states[^1] that the recommended sleep duration for the 18-25 age group is 8 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.

A study[^2] has shown that among 226 medical students, the average sleep duration is 6 hours and 15 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1 hour and 10 minutes.
What hypothesis can we test with this information?

# Task

## Formulate a hypothesis

- Select a metric.
- Formulate the null and alternative hypothesis.
- Determine the level of significance

## Building visualizations (optional)

- Think about what visualizations you can build for this task to better present and interpret the results.

## Calculate statistics

- Calculate statistics for the selected test
- Calculate the p-value.
- Conclude rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis.

## Build a confidence interval

- Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean.
- Interpret the results.

## Estimate the power of the test

- Assume that the actual mean differs by a certain amount (for example, +5% or -5%).
- Estimate the power of the test (the probability of rejecting the alternative hypothesis).
- Plot the power versus sample size.
