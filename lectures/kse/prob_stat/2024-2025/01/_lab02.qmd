# Exercise 1

[Octopus Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus) tried 14 times to guess the winner of a soccer match. 12 times he guessed correctly, 2 times he guessed wrong. We want to test a hypothesis:

 - $H_0$: the octopus guesses the winner of the match with probability 0.5
 - $H_1$: the octopus picks the winner of the match with probability $\neq$ 0.5

You must develop a statistical criterion to test this hypothesis and calculate the $p$-value.

- $H_0: p = 0.5$
- $H_1: p \neq 0.5$
- $S(X) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n X_i \sim Binom(n, 0.5)$ if hypothesis $H_0$ is true.  
- Criterion: $\bigl\{ S(X) \gt u_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} \bigr\} \cup \bigl\{ S(X) \lt u_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \bigr\}$, where $u_{\beta}$ is the critical value equal to the $\beta$-quantile of $Binom(n, 0.5)$,  
- $p$-value = $2 \cdot \text{min}\bigl[P\bigl( S(X) \geqslant S_0 \, \, H_0\bigr), \, P\bigl( S(X) \leqslant S_0 \, \, H_0\bigr), \, P\bigl( S(X) \leqslant S_0 \, \, H_0\bigr)) \bigr]$, where $S_0$ is the value of a statistic from a given sample.

Implement the `check_paul_criterion(n, k, alpha)` function, where:

- `n` &mdash; the number of matches;
- `k` &mdash; the number of correct predictions from the octopus;
- `alpha` &mdash; the significance level of the criterion.

The function should return `PaulCheckResults` with the fields:

- `is_rejected`: whether or not hypothesis $H_0$ was rejected at significance level $\alpha$
- `pvalue`: the $p$-value of the test
