# Input

Today, we will be working with [data](https://aranaur.rbind.io/datasets/heart-transplant/) from The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study.

The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that they were gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable `transplant` indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died. Another variable called `survived` was used to indicate whether the patient was alive at the end of the study[^1].

The data dictionary is as follows:

| Variable   | Description                                                                                                                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | ID number of the patient                                                                                                                                |
| `outcome`    | Survival status with levels `alive` and `deceased`                                                                                                      |
| `transplant` | Transplant group with levels `control` (did not receive a transplant) and `treatment` (received a transplant)                                           |
| `age`        | Age of the patient at the beginning of the study                                                                                                        |
| `survtime`   | Number of days patients were alive after the date they were determined to be a candidate for a heart transplant until the termination date of the study |
| `acceptyear` | Year of acceptance as a heart transplant candidate                                                                                                      |
| `prior`      | Whether or not the patient had prior surgery with levels `yes` and `no`                                                                                 |
| `wait`       | Waiting time for transplant                                                                                                                             |

## Task

1. Load the data and review its structure.
2. Build visualizations to explore the data.
3. Specify the null and alternative hypotheses to use **bootstrap methods** to test the hypothesis.

::: {.callout-note}
You can use any test statistic you find appropriate for the task. If you use a standard metrics (e.g., mean, proportion etc.), please provide a comparative analysis of the results of bootstrap method and common test (p-values, confidence intervals, etc.).

4. Interpret the results of the hypothesis test in the context of the assignment.
5. Provide a conclusion based on the results of the hypothesis test.
